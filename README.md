ganalytics
==========

Interact with **Google Analytics** using **R**

S4 classes and methods for interactive use of the Google Analytics core reporting API using R.


Installation
------------
### 1. Install the necessary packages into R

#### Warning
* The `ganalytics` package and the required branch of `httr` are currently under active development.
* The installation procedure below installs directly from the respective GitHub repositories.

#### Prerequisites
* Ensure you have installed the latest version of [R](http://cran.r-project.org/)
* If using Windows, you will also need the latest version of [RTools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
* For other operating systems, please refer to [installation instructions for devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools/wiki/Philosophy#getting-started)

#### Execute the following statements in R to install `ganalytics` and the required branch of `httr`:

```r
# Install the required packages from CRAN
install.packages(c("devtools", "plyr", "stringr", "RJSONIO", "RCurl", "Rook", "httpuv"), dependencies = TRUE)
# Install ganalytics and httr branches from GitHub.
library(devtools)
install_github(repo = "httr", username = "jdeboer")
install_github(repo = "ganalytics", username = "jdeboer")
# End
```
### 2. Prepare your Google API application
* Browse to [**Google API Console**] (https://code.google.com/apis/console/)
* Check you are **signed in to Google** with the account you wish to use.
* Choose **Create project** from the Google API Console (or choose an existing project if you have one already).
* From the Services page, set the status of **Analytics API** to **ON**.
* You will need to **agree** and **accept** the Google APIs and Analytics API Terms of Service to proceed.
* Go to the **API Access page**, then click the blue button **Create an OAuth 2.0 client ID**.
* Enter a unique **Product Name** (keep in mind you may want to add more Google services in future). This is the only required form field. Click **Next**.
* Within **Client ID Settings**, select **Installed application** as the **Application type** and choose **Other** as the **Installed application type**. Click **Create client ID**.
* Note your **Client ID** and **Client secret**.

_Note: For further information about Google APIs please refer to the References section at the end of this document._

### 3. Set your system environment variables (this is optional but recommended)
* Add the following two user variables:

|     | Variable name                 | Variable value         |
| --- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- |
|   1 | `GANALYTICS_CONSUMER_ID`      | `<Your client ID>`     |
|   2 | `GANALYTICS_CONSUMER_SECRET`  | `<Your client secret>` |

* To do this in Windows 7:
  * Search for and select **"Edit environment variables for your account"** from the Start menu.
  * Within the **Environment variables** window, add the above **User variables** by selecting **New** and entering the **Variable name** and **Variable value**, then click **OK** for each.
  * Click **OK**.
  * **Restart** your computer for the new environment variables to take effect.

  _Note: For other operating systems please refer to the Reference section at the end of this document._

### 4. Authenticate and attempt your first query with ganalytics
* To perform a query you will need to obtain your **Google Analytics profile ID**. This can be accessed from either:
  * using the [Google Analytics Query Explorer tool](http://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/explorer/)
  * the **Admin page** in Google Analytics under **Profile Settings**, or
  * the browser's address bar when viewing a report in Google Analytics - look for the digits between the letter **'p'** and trailing **'/'**, e.g. `.../a11111111w22222222p33333333/` shows a profile ID of `33333333`.

  _Note: A function for accessing your profile IDs within R will be available in the near future._

* Return to R and execute the following, remembering to substitute `profile_id` with the profile ID you noted down:
 
##### If you completed step 3

```r
library(ganalytics)
myQuery <- GaQuery( profile_id )
GetGaData(myQuery)
# End
```

##### If you did NOT complete step 3
In addition to your `profile_id`, also substitute `client_id` and `client_secret` below with your details from step 2

```r
library(ganalytics)
myQuery <- GaQuery( profile_id )
GetGaData(myQuery, key = client_id , secret = client_secret)
# End
```

* You should then be directed to *http://accounts.google.com* within your default web browser asking you to sign-in to your Google account if you are not already. Once signed-in you will be asked to grant read-only access to your Google Analytics account for the Google API product you created in step 1.
* Make sure you are signed in to the Google account you wish to use, then grant access by selecting **"Allow access"**. You can then close the page and return back to R.
* If you have successfully executed all of the above R commands you should see the output of the default `ganalytics` query; visits by day for the past 7 days.

_Note: A small file named `ganalytics_token.RDS` will be saved to your home directory ('My Documents' in Windows) containing your new reusable authentication token._

Examples
--------

As demonstrated in the installation steps above, before executing any of the following examples:
1. load the `ganalytics` package
2. generate a gaQuery object with a Google Analytics profile ID assigned to it.

The following code performs these steps: (Remember to replace `123456789` with the profile ID you wish to use.) 

```r
library(ganalytics)
myQuery <- GaQuery( 123456789 )  # Replace this with your Google Analytics profile ID
# End
```
If you have just completed the installation steps, then you would have done this already.

### Asumptions

The following examples assume you have successfully completed the above steps and that you have set your operating system's **environment variables** as described in step 3.

### Example 1 - Setting the date range

```r
# Set the date range from 1 January 2013 to 31 May 2013: (Dates are specified in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".)
GaDateRange(myQuery) <- c("2013-01-01", "2013-05-31")

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
summary(myData)

# Adjust the start date to 1 March 2013:
GaStartDate(myQuery) <- "2013-03-01"
# Adjust the end date to 31 March 2013:
GaEndDate(myQuery) <- "2013-03-31"

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
summary(myData)
# End
```

### Example 2 - Choosing what metrics to report

```r
# Report number of page views instead
GaMetrics(myQuery) <- "pageviews"

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
summary(myData)

# Report both pageviews and visits
GaMetrics(myQuery) <- c("pageviews", "visits")
# These variations are also acceptable
GaMetrics(myQuery) <- c("ga:pageviews", "ga.Visits")

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
summary(myData)
# End
```

### Example 3 - Selecting what dimensions to split your metrics by

```r
#Â Similar to metrics, but for dimensions
GaDimensions(myQuery) <- c("year", "week", "dayofweek", "hour")

# Lets set a wider date range
GaDateRange(myQuery) <- c("2012-10-01", "2013-03-31")

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
head(myData)
tail(myData)
# End
```

### Example 4 - Sort by

```r
# Sort by descending number of pageviews
GaSortBy(myQuery) <- "-pageviews"

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
head(myData)
tail(myData)
# End
```

### Example 5 - Row filters

```r
# Filter for Sunday visits only
sundayExpr <- GaExpr("dayofweek", "=", "0")
GaFilter(myQuery) <- sundayExpr

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
head(myData)

# Remove the filter
GaFilter(myQuery) <- NULL

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
head(myData)
# End
```

### Example 6 - Combining filters with AND

```r
# Expression to define Sunday visits
sundayExpr <- GaExpr("dayofweek", "=", "0")
# Expression to define organic search visits
organicExpr <- GaExpr("medium", "=", "organic")
# Expression to define organic search visits made on a Sunday
sundayOrganic <- GaAnd(sundayExpr, organicExpr)
GaFilter(myQuery) <- sundayOrganic

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
head(myData)

# Let's concatenate medium to the dimensions for our query
GaDimensions(myQuery) <- c(GaDimensions(myQuery), "medium")

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
head(myData)
# End
```

### Example 7 - Combining filters with OR

```r
# In a similar way to AND
loyalExpr <- GaExpr("visitCount", "!~", "^[0-3]$") # Made more than 3 visits
recentExpr <- GaExpr("daysSinceLastVisit", "~", "^[0-6]$") # Visited sometime within the past 7 days.
loyalOrRecent <- GaOr(loyalExpr, recentExpr)
GaFilter(myQuery) <- loyalOrRecent

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
summary(myData)
# End
```

### Example 8 - Filters that combine ORs with ANDs

```r
loyalExpr <- GaExpr("visitCount", "!~", "^[0-3]$") # Made more than 3 visits
recentExpr <- GaExpr("daysSinceLastVisit", "~", "^[0-6]$") # Visited sometime within the past 7 days.
loyalOrRecent <- GaOr(loyalExpr, recentExpr)
sundayExpr <- GaExpr("dayofweek", "=", "0")
loyalOrRecent_Sunday <- GaAnd(loyalOrRecent, sundayExpr)
GaFilter(myQuery) <- loyalOrRecent_Sunday

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
summary(myData)

# Perform the same query but change which dimensions to view
# - Notice "daysSince" is conveniently accepted as a partial match for "daysSinceLastVisit".
GaDimensions(myQuery) <- c("visitCount", "daysSince", "dayOfWeek")

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
summary(myData)
# End
```
### Example 9 - Sorting 'numeric' dimensions (continuing from example 8)

```r
# Continuing from example 8...

# Change filter to loyal visit AND recent visits AND visited on Sunday
loyalAndRecent_Sunday <- GaAnd(loyalExpr, recentExpr, sundayExpr)
GaFilter(myQuery) <- loyalAndRecent_Sunday

# Sort by decending visit count and ascending days since last visit.
GaSortBy(myQuery) <- c("-visitCount", "+daysSince")
myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
head(myData)

# Notice that Google Analytics' Core Reporting API doesn't recognise 'numerical' dimensions as
# ordered factors when sorting. We can use R to sort instead, using a plyr::arrange function.
library(plyr)
myData <- arrange(myData, desc(visitCount), daysSinceLastVisit)
head(myData)
tail(myData)
# End
```
### Example 10 - Visit segmentation

```r
# Visit segmentation is expressed similarly to row filters and supports AND and OR combinations.
# Define a segment for visits where a "thank-you", "thankyou" or "success" page was viewed.
thankyouExpr <- GaExpr("pagePath", "~", "thank\\-?you|success")
GaSegment(myQuery) <- thankyouExpr

# Reset the filter
GaFilter(myQuery) <- NULL

# Split by traffic source and medium
GaDimensions(myQuery) <- c("source", "medium")

# Sort by decending number of visits
GaSortBy(myQuery) <- "-visits"

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
head(myData)
# End
```

### Example 11 - Using automatic pagination to get more than 10,000 rows of data per query

```r
# Visits by date and hour for the years 2011 (leap year) and 2012: 2 * 365.5 * 24 = 17544 rows
# First let's clear any filters or segments defined previously
GaFilter(myQuery) <- NULL
GaSegment(myQuery) <- NULL
# Define our date range
GaDateRange(myQuery) <- c("2011-01-01", "2012-12-31")
# Define our metrics and dimensions
GaMetrics(myQuery) <- "visits"
GaDimensions(myQuery) <- c("date", "dayOfWeek", "hour")
# Let's allow a maximum of 17544 rows (default is 10000)
GaMaxResults(myQuery) <- 17544

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)
nrow(myData)

## Let's use plyr::ddply to analyse the data
library(plyr)

# Visits by day of week
visits_by_dayOfWeek <- ddply(myData, ~dayOfWeek, summarise, visits = sum(visits))
with(visits_by_dayOfWeek, barplot(visits, names.arg=dayOfWeek))

# Visits by hour of day
visits_by_hour <- ddply(myData, ~hour, summarise, visits = sum(visits))
with(visits_by_hour, barplot(visits, names.arg=hour))
# End
```

### Example 12 - Using ggplot2
To run this example first install ggplot2 if you haven't already.
```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
#End
```

Once installed, then run the following example.
```r
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)

# Visits by date and hour for the years 2011 (leap year) and 2012: 2 * 365.5 * 24 = 17544 rows
# First let's clear any filters or segments defined previously
GaFilter(myQuery) <- NULL
GaSegment(myQuery) <- NULL
# Define our date range
GaDateRange(myQuery) <- c("2011-01-01", "2012-12-31")
# Define our metrics and dimensions
GaMetrics(myQuery) <- "visits"
GaDimensions(myQuery) <- c("date", "dayOfWeek", "hour", "isMobile")
# Let's allow a maximum of 40000 rows (default is 10000)
GaMaxResults(myQuery) <- 40000

myData <- GetGaData(myQuery)

# Visits by hour of day and day of week
avg_visits_by_hour_wday_mobile <- ddply(myData, ~hour + dayOfWeek + isMobile, summarise, visits = mean(visits))

# Relabel the days of week
levels(avg_visits_by_hour_wday_mobile$dayOfWeek) <- c("Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat")

# Plot the summary data
qplot(
  x = hour,
  y = visits,
  data = avg_visits_by_hour_wday_mobile,
  facets = ~dayOfWeek,
  fill = isMobile,
  geom = "bar",
  position = "stack",
  stat = "identity"
)

# End
```

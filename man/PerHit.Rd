\usage{
PerHit(object, ...)

\S4method{PerHit}{.compoundExpr}(object, ...)

\S4method{PerHit}{gaMetExpr}(object, ...)

\S4method{PerHit}{formula}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a gaMetExpr object to coerce to hit-level or if multiple
expressions are provided, then the first expression to combine into a
single step of sequence filter.}

\item{...}{Further expressions to be included in the filter definition if
defining a sequence filter of length one.}
}
\value{
a gaMetExpr or gaSegmentSequenceFilter.
}
\description{
Set the scope of a gaMetExpr object to hit-level, or transforms a condition
filter to a sequence filter of length one (i.e. a combination of conditions
for matching a single hit).
}
\section{Methods (by class)}{
\itemize{
\item \code{.compoundExpr}: Create a single step sequence filter from the supplied
expression.

\item \code{gaMetExpr}: Set the scope of the supplied metric condition to
hit-level.

\item \code{formula}: Set the scope of the supplied non-standard-evaluation
metric condition to hit-level.
